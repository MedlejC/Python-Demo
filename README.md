## Reading data from CSV file:

### 1- Setting up the environment:

1- I had to setup venv to properly use python on my machine (Macbook Air M1, tool: Microsoft Visual Studio Code)
`bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install pandas
    `

2- To deactivate it, simply run: `deactivate`  
 To reactivate it: `source venv/bin/activate`
